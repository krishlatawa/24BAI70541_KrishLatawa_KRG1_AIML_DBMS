📖 Library Management System Database 🧪 Experiment 1.1 🎯 Aim

To create a Library Management System database in PostgreSQL by defining tables with appropriate constraints and implementing DDL, DML, and DCL operations along with role-based access control.

🛠️ Tools Used

🐘 PostgreSQL

🧰 pgAdmin

📌 Experiment Overview

This experiment focuses on designing a database to store and manage:

Book details

Library visitor information

Book issue records

Tables are created using primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints to maintain data integrity. Sample records are inserted to verify the working of constraints and relationships.

🔐 Security Implementation

A database role named LIBRARIAN is created with login access. Required privileges are granted and revoked on tables to demonstrate role-based database security.

⚙️ Operations Performed

Table creation and modification (DDL)

Record insertion, update, and retrieval (DML)

Role creation, privilege grant, and revoke (DCL)

✅ Result

Library database created successfully

Data integrity enforced using constraints

Role-based access control implemented

🏁 Conclusion

This experiment provides practical understanding of database creation, data manipulation, and access control using PostgreSQL.
