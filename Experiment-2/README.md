Practical/Experiment steps:
1.	Display the department name and the average salary of employees for each department.

2.	Consider only those employees whose salary is greater than 20,000.

3.	Display only those departments where the average salary is greater than 30,000.

4.	Arrange the final output in descending order of average salary.




Note:   Use the following SQL clauses in your query:
●	WHERE

●	GROUP BY

●	HAVING

●	ORDER BY
