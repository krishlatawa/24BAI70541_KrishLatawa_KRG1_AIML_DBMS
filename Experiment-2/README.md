Experiment 1.2 – SQL SELECT Queries Using Clauses
Objective
The objective of this experiment is to understand and implement SQL SELECT queries using various clauses such as WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY to retrieve and analyze data from a relational database.

Practical / Experiment Steps
Create an EMPLOYEE table with required fields.
Insert sample employee records into the table.
Apply filtering using the WHERE clause.
Group employee records using GROUP BY.
Calculate average salary using aggregate functions.
Filter grouped data using HAVING.
Sort the final result using ORDER BY.
Procedure of the Experiment
Start the system and log in.
Open PostgreSQL using pgAdmin.
Connect to the required database.
Create the EMPLOYEE table.
Insert sample records into the table.
Write the SQL query using WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses.
Execute the query.
Verify the output obtained.
Take screenshots for record.
Input / Output Details
Input
